# oci-starter

## Usage:
### 1. Website 

Go to: [starter.wedoteam.io](https://starter.wedoteam.io/)

- Make your choices.
- Generate. You will get a zip file. ( ex:starter.zip )
- Upload the zip file in OCI Shell. Then
- Still in OCI Shell:

```
unzip starter.zip
cd starter
./build.sh
Then click on the UI_URL at then end of the build
```

### 2. Cloud Shell / Command Line 

- Go to OCI Home page.
- Start "Cloud Shell" icon on top/right

```
git clone https://github.com/MarcGueury/oci-starter 
cd oci-starter
./oci_starter.sh -prefix test -language java -deploy compute -db_password LiveLab__12345 
cd output
./build.sh
Then click on the UI_URL at then end of the build
```

To destroy:
```
cd output
./destroy.sh
> Do you really want to destroy all resources? yes
```


Best practice: 
- Run the command in compartment
    - Go to menu "Identity & Security"
    - Compartment
        - Find or create your compartment_id
```
...
./oci_starter.sh -compartment_ocid ocid1.compartment.oc1..xxx -prefix test -language java -deploy compute -db_password LiveLab__12345 
...
```
